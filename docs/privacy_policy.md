# Privacy policy for the Translate Selected Text extension

The Translate Selected Text extension allows you to translate a piece of text
that you have selected, by right clicking the selected text and clicking the
context menu extension option. When doing this, the text you selected will be
used for the sole purpose of opening a new Google Translate tab/window which
will show you the translation, but the extension will not keep any record of
that nor share it with any third party. The use of Google Translate is subject
to their [Terms of Service and Privacy Policy][1].

Your extension options will be saved in your browser, and synced between all the
browsers you've synced in the browser settings.
