# Development
In order to work with the extension, take a look at
[the docs](https://gerrit.avm99963.com/plugins/gitiles/infinitegforums/+/118bd342b9c207916baaea917f376b45e2ddc105/docs/contributing.md#contribute-code-changes)
for this other extension that I developed. The infrastructure involved with this
extension is almost identical to the one for that extension.

In the near future I will extend the documentation for the Translate Selected
Text project.
