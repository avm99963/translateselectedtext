## Beta version
As this extension has so many users, I've decided to upload a Beta version of
the extension to the Chrome Web Store so I can test it before uploading any
update to the stable version! This way I can make sure that the stable version
of the extension is 100% bug-free.

If you want to test the bleeding edge of this extension before everybody else,
join the Google Group and download the extension (there may be bugs, you've been
warned):
