## Beta version
As this extension has so many users, I've decided to upload a Beta version of
the extension to the Chrome Web Store so I can test it before uploading any
update to the stable version! This way I can make sure that the stable version
of the extension is 100% bug-free.

If you want to test the bleeding edge of this extension before everybody else,
join the Google Group and download the extension (there may be bugs, you've been
warned):

## Special thanks
Special thanks to:
* All the users who use the extension every day and who trust the model of
developing simple extensions which do not request any privacy-breaking
permissions.
* All the users who [have contributed translations](https://crowdin.com/project/translateselectedtext/activity_stream). You rock!
* BrowserStack for allowing me to use their awesome services in order to test
the extension in multiple versions of Chrome and in different operating systems.
