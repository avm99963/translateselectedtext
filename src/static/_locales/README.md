# _locales folder
This folder contains the extension strings in various languages.

*** note
**Warning:** The only file that should be modified in this folder is the
`en/messages.json` file.

After modifying that file, it should get uploaded to Crowdin so it can be
translated there, and afterwards the `downloadTranslations.bash` script at the
`//tools/i18n` directory can be run to generate all the other subfolders.
